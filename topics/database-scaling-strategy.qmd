The following table identifies scenarios that require different scaling solutions.

|Requirement|Solution|
|---|---|
|Do you have to manage and scale multiple Azure SQL databases that have varying and unpredictable resource requirements?|SQL elastic pools|
|Are you developing a new application with a single database that you want to test before launching it to thousands of users?|Azure SQL Database or SQL Managed Instance|
|Do you need to optimize the price performance for a group of databases within a prescribed budget while delivering performance elasticity for each database?|SQL elastic pools|

Consider cost together with your scaling strategy to find an optimal solution.
