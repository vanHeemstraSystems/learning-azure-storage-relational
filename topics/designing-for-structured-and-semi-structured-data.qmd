# Designing for Structured and Semi-Structured Data

![Data Storage](../images/data-storage.png){.center .image-large}

To design Azure storage, you first must determine what type of data you have:

- **Structured data** includes relational data and has a shared schema.
- **Semi-structured** is less organized than structured data and isn't stored in a relational format.
- **Unstructured data** is the least organized type of data.
